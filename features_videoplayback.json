I'm gonna have to commit to the commit to the training schedule and I'm gonna have to commit to, you know, potentially losing some weight so I can get faster and the whole thing just scares me. But I want to vlog it. I want to vlog the whole process just like I did for Iron Man. You know, being creative doing this type of thing and putting it out there is just in my DNA. I need to do it and so I'm gonna do it. Obviously, I understand I've been offline for months, have I made videos for, you know, that whole time. And I also understand if your opinion of me has potentially changed over the last few months, you know, I spent the first half of my career criticizing people and judging people online. So, you know, I don't begrudge your judgment of me by any means. I just think all I can do right now and moving forward is just try to be the best person I can be for myself and for my family and just try to continue putting the best shit out there that I can. So that's what I'm gonna do. And if you stick around to watch it, I very much appreciate it from the from the bottom of my heart truly. And so that's the plan. 330 marathon in March, hopefully, and you're gonna see the process. So I will see you soon and Chuchu. Blow it turned into a train at the end. Chuchu.",
