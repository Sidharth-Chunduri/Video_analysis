Because they're the ones who get it seen and get it shared. And I think that's where most people get it wrong. They're talking to you here. Instead of talking to you, random person scrolling Facebook. Thanks for the click. To see back in 2009, we all have these weird little things called attention spans. Yeah, they're gone. They're gone. We killed them. They're dead. I'm trying to think of the last time I watched an 18-minute TED talk. It's been years, literally years. So if you're given a TED talk, keep it quick. I'm doing mine in under a minute. I'm at 44 seconds right now. That means we've got time for one final joke. Why are balloons so expensive? Inflation. What the hell.",

And now here we are done with high school. As Charles Dickens put it it was the best of times it was the worst of times. But now we are through with the stressful days of the baby and ACT testing. We've raised tens of thousands of dollars to courts and cans and inhaled hundreds of pounds of baby powder during football. We have survived WHS screenshots.

Does that change how you think about energy? So what's a fact that shocks the audience into rethinking? And Google has transformed your ability to get at these facts. Given two or three minutes, you can find out one whether anything I've said is true, but you trust me because I look the part and I'm from ESC. Those are in fact two true facts. I usually get someone come up to me at the end, I'm sure how do they measure dead in a life. But it's true and it's not even close.",

Not sad. So I think there's only three ways of starting a speech. And it's the same if you went into a bar. And there's a group of people, it's a networking event, much like you were at before you walked into this room. And maybe I came up to a group. This group of three people are having a little conversation. I walk in and I say, hi, I'm Connor. I'm Irish, 38 years old. I have an interest in sailing. I like running. And they've walked away. So how do you get people to engage with you when you're networking?",

Obviously, I understand I've been offline for months, have it made videos for that whole time. And I also understand if your opinion of me has potentially changed over the last few months, you know, I spent the first half of my career criticizing people and judging people online. So, you know, I don't begrudge your judgment of me by any means. I just think all I can do right now, moving forward is just try to be the best person I can be for myself and for my family and just try to continue putting the best shit out there that I can.

While the slow loves they take such small chunks of time out of our days and we can still Eat the rest of what's on our plate Like they are the sweet treat at the end of the day But we still fulfilled the main course which were our responsibilities and our ambitions and I'd say that's a well-balanced meal We would love to have well-balanced meals as our well-balanced loves But with the fast loves it gave us no room left in our bodies to have that love for other things That actually correlates to one of the main reasons us so why I'm scared to fall in love again Love is consuming It's not to say that I don't want to give this time an energy The problem is that I do from the first time that I fell in love",

Try to make it a challenge to spend one hour more than you normally do right now outside. Then you'll start thinking of more cool ideas of things you can do around where you live. I also made more videos talking about things you can do outside and also have a little like my night community. I'm in there and other people are in there and we're all sharing ideas, challenges, things we can do to get better. So if you want to join that for free, you can in the link in the description. A habit that I'm really glad I got into which if you haven't, I highly recommend you start getting into this because you need to do this before it's too late.

That's tying your worst to someone else's inability to love properly. You don't want to be loved. You want to be exceptional. You want to be the one who changed them. You want to be the one they couldn't ignore. You want to be the person who finally got through to someone who would never let anyone else in. Because if you can earn the love of the emotionally unavailable, then maybe finally you can stop doubting yourself. You can stop asking what's wrong with you. But this is where the whole thing collapses in my love. Because even if they choose you, you still won't believe it. Because the wound didn't begin with them. It began with you. And no one can love you into healing the parts of yourself you refuse to meet. So how do you hear?",
  "14": " To answer that question, I had to find out where the infected mosquitoes were in South Australia, and traditionally testing mosquitoes for virus has always been difficult. So I used a new technique. It takes these cards, which are embedded with virus preserving chemicals, and coats them in honey. Mosquitos will come to feed on the honey, and in the process, spit virus onto the card where it can later be detected. Now no one had ever used this technique in a broad-scale virus survey before, so I had to adapt it. I developed new traps, and set them at over 100 field sites across South Australia. Then I captured over 20,000 hungry mosquitoes and let them feed on the card for a week before testing the cards for virus. Now you may not think that these traps look very impressive, but science doesn't have to be beautiful. It has to be effective, and these traps are proving to be our most sensitive method of detecting infected mosquitoes. I found three types of infection, Roscoe verviress, Barmophorus virus, and Stratford virus, which has never before been found in South Australia. I now have the virus data I need to conduct my analysis, and I'm collecting...",

It's not that it was simple. It was that When you're researching you don't you kind of get into this thing where you don't want to completely just steal the quote from an article You want to understand what the quote means so you can apply it to something else But that's a really hard thing to do if you don't like have a deep understanding of the subject So for example, imagine I'm an alien and I read a paper that said the earth's sky is blue Cool now for this convoluted example Let's imagine that I'm writing a paper explaining why earth is the perfect vacation spot and I'm saying that the earth's guy is always blue Well technically the article didn't say that it was always blue.

I want to apologize to anyone who's seen the video. I want to apologize to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness or depression or suicide. But most importantly, I want to apologize to the victim and his family. For my fans who are defending my actions, please don't. They do not deserve to be defended.

But we might also need other information, for example, from the red interval, which isn't really represented in the yellow. So we draw an arrow from red to green. Now, if we want to reproduce the little chunk of the computation that happened during the green time interval, all we need to do is follow those arrows backward to get the information from the end of the previous time intervals. We only did this for green, but you can do the same for every time interval, connecting it to the previous ones to show the flow of information. This is a graph. Each time interval is a node, and they are connected by edges. We can unroll this graph to reveal exactly how each time interval depends on the others. For example, the per-",
  "13": " Why are sperm whales called sperm whales? Because if you chomp one of them open, you'll find that its head is full of slimy stuff that looks kind of like cum. Yes, that's actually why they're called that. To this day, it's not clear what the actual biological purpose of that stuff is for a whale, but for humans, it's difficult to overstate how important this whale come. Spurmasetti, if you want to be fancy about it, was to the 19th century economy. Spurmasetti was the high grade stuff, but the entire blubbery mass of a whale could be melted down into whale oil, which was used for everything that we use every type of oil for these days. The main use was for fueling oil lamps. Almost everywhere there would be a light bulb today, there would have been an oil lamp fueled by whale oil. That or a candle with wax made from spermacetti. With the industrial revolution in full swing, humans needed lubricants, and the best lube in the world was made from whale oil.",

My friend Lane posted on Facebook that he was going or wanted to go so I contacted him and found out that he was going with an organization that were running their third annual surf school. So I asked if I could join the team and come along. So the guy organizing these trips has been visiting North Korea for 17 years, doing humanitarian relief work. He doesn't work for the government but he has been building a relationship with the government and with the people there. And I don't want to jeopardize any of the work that he's done with the content I've been creating. So Philip DeFranco, he's a popular YouTuber and he made a video about this unfolding drama. He criticised me with an analogy about being taken on a tour around a big mansion knowing that there's rooms with murder and torture going on in them. But only being shown to the rooms like the nice swimming pool and the kitchen and the games room and then leaving that mansion just talking about those things. My only question to that is what about the people?",

I said the worst word I could possibly think of and it just sort of slipped out and I'm not gonna make any excuses to why it did because there are no excuses for it. I'm disappointed in myself because it seems like I've learned nothing from all these past controversies and it's not that I think I can say or do whatever I want and get away with it. That's not it at all. I'm just an idiot. But that doesn't make what I said or how I said it. Okay, it was not okay. I'm really sorry if I offended, hurt or disappointed anyone with all of this. Being in the position I am, I should know better. I know I can keep messing up like this. And I owe it to my audience and to myself to do better than this because I know I'm better than this. By the way there are ensure that I know I can make the right answer if not a world but a single person can figure out about it."
